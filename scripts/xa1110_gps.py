xa1110_gps.py


https://github.com/sbow/xa1110_i2c_python_GPS


A python driver for interacting with the Sparkfun GPS-14414 chip - an i2c based GPS products using a XA1110 gps chip.

This driver implements communication with the chip using i2c, via the smbus2 library

NOTE:
    root access typically required to access i2c
    either grant permission to user for i2c, or run with sudo, "sudo python xa1110_gps.py"
